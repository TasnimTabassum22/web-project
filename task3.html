    <h1>ABOUT Song</h1>
<p>

    The song “love me like you do” is going to start playing when Satine is on stage after she has told Christian to leave because she is dying and doesn’t want him there. When she sings the first line he stops and turns around. He than joins in and stays to perform the last scene with her because he wants to be there when she dies. The songs helps the audience understand that there love is like a light in the darkness because they not suppose to be together the Duke forbids it. It also shows that it doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks they know that there love is forever.
